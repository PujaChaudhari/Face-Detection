# Real time Face-Detection
This project was done with this fantastic “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. So, it’s perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera. “ Haar Cascade Frontal Face classifier" is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect face in other images.
Model is train with transfer Learning Technique (VGG16).
Model has achieved 95% accuracy and 97% validation accuracy and minimum loss. Categorical cross-entropy is used as loss function .
